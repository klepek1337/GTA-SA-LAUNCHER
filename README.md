# GTA-SA SAMP MTA + MORE STEAM LAUNCHER  

## Instructions:  

## How to launch with the Steam version:  

1. Make a backup of GTA Steam if you have an additional crack; it's not necessary.  
   - Open **Steam** and find the game **GTA San Andreas** in your game library.  
   - Right-click on the game and select **"Properties"**.  
   - In the **"Local Files"** tab, click **"Backup game files"**.  
   - Choose a location where you want to save the backup.  
   - Copy the launcher exe file to the original path where the game launches from.  

## Important notes:  
- The program requires creating a game backup and changing the game shortcut to point to the correct version of the program's EXE that you want to launch.  
- Remember, the original EXE file for **GTA San Andreas** will not work directly. It requires using the shortcut from the backup.  
- If you donâ€™t have Python installed, the program will install it automatically.  

Here is the latest version of the program, which may look different and work better than the one you see:
